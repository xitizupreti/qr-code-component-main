## My process

I first created HTML DOM model in my NoteCopy and Deployed it in VS Code. It was easy to solve. After that I put CSS Design which was quite hard for me. But after few hours my friend gave me idea for it and solved easily.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

```justify-content â€” controls alignment of all items on the main axis. align-items â€” controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.```

### Useful resources

- [@Media Rule](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS @media Rule. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
